# ConsultantMailApp
This Django application is designed to facilitate communication between project consultants, assistants, and students by automating the email notification process. The app reads data from a CSV file containing information about student projects, including student IDs, consultants, and assistants.
<hr/>
The application provides two main options for sending email notifications:

1. Consultant-Only Notifications: This option sends an email to the project consultant with details about the student ID.

2. Consultant and Assistant Notifications: This option sends emails to both the consultant and the assistant. The emails include information about the student ID and the roles of the consultant and assistant.

By using this application, project coordinators can streamline communication and ensure that all relevant parties are informed about the project assignments and details.
