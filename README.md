# ConsultantMailApp
This Django application is designed to facilitate communication between project consultants, assistants, and students by automating the email notification process. The app reads data from a CSV file containing information about student projects, including student IDs, consultants, and assistants.

The application provides two main options for sending email notifications:

Consultant-Only Notifications: This option sends an email to the project consultant with details about the student ID.

Consultant and Assistant Notifications: This option sends emails to both the consultant and the assistant. The emails include information about the student ID and the roles of the consultant and assistant.

By using this application, project coordinators can streamline communication and ensure that all relevant parties are informed about the project assignments and details.

Features
CSV File Integration: Easily import project data from a CSV file with columns for student ID, consultant, consultant email, assistant, and assistant email.

Flexible Notification Options: Choose between sending notifications to only the consultant or to both the consultant and assistant.

Automated Email Dispatch: Automatically send emails using configured SMTP settings, reducing the manual effort involved in project coordination.

User Interface: The application features a user-friendly interface designed with HTML and CSS, allowing users to interact with the application easily and efficiently. The interface provides options to upload CSV files and select the desired notification method.

This app is particularly useful for academic institutions or organizations managing multiple projects where regular updates and communication are essential for project success.
